# Scope
The scope of this app is to provide a service to students(primary) and teachers regarding online assignment submission as well designed for home Tuition services. During Covid-19 schools are closed. Therefore, junior students are unable to submit their worksheets, handwritten assignments physically. Parwaz introduces the concept of a digital notebook.

# Educational Goals
In Pakistan, educational trend changes after the pandemic. Most students drop their school cause of financial issues (expenses of course books, worksheets, and notes books).On the contrary, teachers are also laid off from their jobs and facing unemployment issues. we firmly believe that Parwaz not only helps students as well as a support teacher for earning money.
